			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					Iâ€™m Gian (pronounced jee-yin), a product designer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was born and raised in the Bay. I'm quite fond of the people and the mild weather here, although I would like to live elsewhere in the world.
				<p>
					Iâ€™m currently at <a href="https://www.presencelearning.com/" target="_blank">PresenceLearning</a>, improving teletherapy for special education therapists and students.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Previously, I worked at <a href="https://carta.com/" target="_blank">Carta</a>, a fintech company, where I designed new equity-related features for private and public companies.

		<h2>A bit more about me...</h2>
		<h3><em>I like building my appreciation of everything.</em></h3>
		<p>	
			I'm constantly looking to better understand myself, other people, and the world around me. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			I like evolving my perspective and looking for the fascinating parts of seemingly mundane things.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thankfully, I'm very rarely bored because I find many things (including life itself) so interesting.	
		</p>
		<p>
			I like to do this by...	
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Challenging myself.</b> I like to challenge myself physically through exercise (nothing wild, usually resistance training and cardio) and mentally by doing uncomfortable things that can help me grow. I find it important to keep a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_growth_mindset">growth mindset</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Asking questions.</b> I'm a curious person so I tend to ask a lot of questions. If I were here, Iâ€™d ask you "What made you visit my website?" ðŸ¤” â€¨
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Writing.</b> I write a daily reflection to practice mindfulness and look for patterns in my thoughts and emotions. I also like to write while working on projects as a way to organize and clarify my thoughts.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Consuming interesting content.</b> Books, videos, movies, blogs, and games primarily. I often get inspired by the great work of others.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Traveling.</b> Most recently, I visited Japan. I liked so many things about the trip including the people, food, convenient public transportation, diverse architecture, and the walkability of the cities I visited.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Meeting and talking to new people.</b> Iâ€™m generally introverted but I find other people really interesting and fun to interact with.
		</p>
		<p class="large-margin-bottom">
			<b>Slowing down.</b> As much as I love doing lots of different things, I find slowing down and doing nothing healthy. For me, this takes the form of taking walks or sitting around with no distractions.
		</p>

		<h3><em>I took a non-traditional path to design.</em></h3>

		<p>I have a degree in Kinesiology. My college education consisted of science (including biology, psychology, chemistry, physiology) and exercise-related coursework. My original goal entering college was to become a physical therapist, a path I pursued because of my interest in science and years of experience in sports (cross country, track and field, and rowing). </p>
		<p>Iâ€™ve found my academic background comes into play when Iâ€™m learning about new domains, interpreting data, and testing designs with people.</p>
		<p>I started by trying <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org</a> out of curiosity and building some web apps. I found the work both interesting and rewarding and decided to continue learning.</p> 
		<p>I learned everything independently by building side projects and consuming various free videos, articles, and interactive content. I'm thankful for the people that created and shared valuable content for people like me.</p>
		<p>This eventually led me to join Carta at around 150 employees as a product designer, where I did both design and some front-end code.
		</p>
		<p>In hindsight, this path seems obvious as it involves my interests in technology, art, and design. At the time, I didn't consider that my time spent drawing pictures and designing things like school club t-shirts and forum signatures meant anything.
		</p>
		<p class="large-margin-bottom">Likewise, my hours spent playing Neopets, Runescape, and other browser-based games in the early-mid 2000s.</p>

		<h3>I love video games!</h3>
		<p>The first video game I've ever played was Pokemon Pinball for the Game Boy Color and I've been in love ever since. </p>
		<p>Some of my fondest memories are from playing games with friends. </p>
		<p>Video games are a huge inspiration to me in crafting compelling experiences. I'm amazed by how the various disciplines come together to create impactful, memorable, and entertaining products for the world to enjoy.</p>
		<p class="large-margin-bottom">Most recently, I've been playing Mass Effect: Legendary Edition and I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Halo: Infinite!â€¨</p>
