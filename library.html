			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p class="callout">
				<a href="https://www.presencelearning.com//">PresenceLearning</a> is an online special education therapy platform where special education therapists or "providers" connect with students with special needs via video calls to help them achieve their goals.
			</p>
			<p>Providers contract with PresenceLearning and remotely connect with students to help schools meet their special education needs.</p>

					The Library is where special education therapists can find activities, like worksheets and videos, to use with their students with special needs in the Virtual Therapy Room.
				</p>
				<p>
					Access to the content library is a large selling point for the product — It keeps the content fresh for students and allows providers to explore new activities for their work that potentially have a greater therapy impact.
				</p>
				<p>
					We started a redesign of the Library to address its usability issues and improve a core part of the platform.

			<h2>Users</h2>
				<div class="image-container"><img class="project-image" src="img/provider.png"></div>
				<p><b>Primary user: Providers (Special Education Therapists)</b></p> 
				<p>These are licensed clinicians who work with students with special needs. Their professions include speech therapists, occupational therapists, and school psychologists.</p>
				<p class="margin-bottom">Their technological literacy can range from low to high depending on their experience with teletherapy. Some are new to relying on software for their work, as their roles are traditionally in-person.</p>
				<div class="image-container"><img class="project-image" src="img/student.png"></div>
				<p><b>Secondary user: Students with special needs</b></p> 
				<p>Providers work remotely with K-12 students with special needs in the Virtual Therapy Room.</p>
				<p>They are highly engaged by specific subjects of interest. Often, therapists need to find very specific content otherwise their students disengage quickly from therapy sessions.</p>
			</div>	
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="section-text">
			<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p class="callout"><b>Usability issues</b> in the Library made it difficult to <b>find and save</b> relevant content for students.</b></p>
				<p>It isn't easy for providers to access and discover appropriate and relevant content due to how the Library is designed.</p> 
				<p>This takes time and energy away from therapy, where they're directly making an impact with their students.</p>
				<p>Additionally, user feedback over the years highlighted usability issues: Users are having <b>trouble performing basic actions</b> like searching, browsing, and finding relevant activities to use with students.</p>
				<p>With this in mind, we decided this was a high-impact project to start tackling to improve the product significantly.</p>
			</div>	
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="section-text large-margin-bottom">
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p class="callout">I started this project with research: I learned about the Library and how it's used today, reviewed customer feedback, and defined user end goals.</p>
				<p><b>I talked to people and learned about the Library.</b> I met with our clinical team — people who were formerly users of PresenceLearning and who are closely connected to users — to better understand the Library and how it's used.</p>
				<p><b>I reviewed relevant user feedback.</b> I found and collected user feedback about the Library from various internal sources. I distilled the feedback down to the common themes and problems that providers were facing.</p>
				<p><b>I defined user end-goals.</b> I also worked with the clinical team to define providers' end goals in relation to the Library and their work.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<div class="section-text large-margin-bottom">
					<h3 class="margin-bottom">Design Audit</h3>
					<p class="callout">I measured the current design against the user end goals to evaluate its effectiveness.</p>
					<div class="callout-box large-margin-bottom">
						<p><b>User end goals</b></p>
						<ul class="remove-indent bullet-list">
							<li>Provide high-quality therapy to students <b>while following their schedule</b>.</li>
							<li>Easily find <b>relevant, high-quality therapy materials</b> that fit the needs of their students.</li>
							<li>Quickly and easily <b>find and access specific therapy materials</b> during sessions.</li>
							<li><b>Minimize</b> preparation time for sessions.</li>

						<b>Current Library design.</b> In the middle is a list of activities that providers can view and save. They save activities by dragging and dropping them into the queues (saved lists of activities) at the right of the screen.
					</p>

				<div class="image-container"><img class="project-image" src="img/librarydetails.png"></div>
				<div class="section-text large-margin-bottom">
					<p>
						<b>Activity details view.</b> This is the detail view of an activity where users get access to actions like previewing the full worksheet(s). They can also save the activity via the "Add to Queue" button.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section-text large-margin-bottom">
					<p>Providers try to find activities that work well for their students based on the student's special education goals, their cognitive abilities, and their subjects of interest (e.g. seasons, school, animals). </p>
					<p>Once they find an activity they want to use, they save them to a queue (saved lists of activities).</p> 
					<p>Providers often have many queues and organize them in a variety of ways, including by student, activity type, and subject (e.g. /r/ sounds, managing anger, gross motor exercises).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section-text">
					<div class="callout-box large-margin-bottom">
						<b>Key findings from design audit</b>
						<ul class="remove-indent bullet-list">
							<li>It's difficult to assess activity <b>quality and relevance</b> without previewing the activity.</li>
							<li>Important actions (previewing activities and saving them to a queue) are <b>high effort</b>.</li>
							<li>Visual design is <b>unpolished</b> and <b>reduces usability</b>.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				<p class="xlarge-margin-bottom">I considered these findings and the rest of my research as I moved into creating new designs.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<div class="section-text">
					<h3 class="margin-bottom">Low-fidelity design</h3>
					<p class="callout">I ran usability tests to validate the design and give me a sense of what the team should prioritize for development.</p>
					<p>The new design:</p>
					<ul class="remove-indent bullet-list">
						<li>Simplifies the <b>information architecture</b> of the Library.</li>
						<li><b>Improves</b> the design of the activity cards by <b>surfacing key actions</b>.</li>
						<li>Introduces a new idea: <b>Collections</b>, which would group the highest-quality, most-used content by subject to make <b>quality activities easier to find</b>.</li>
					</ul>

				</div>
				<div class="section-text">
					<div class="callout-box large-margin-bottom">
					<b>Key findings from usability tests</b>
					<ul class="remove-indent bullet-list">
						<li>Participants went to <b>search first</b> when prompted with finding a specific kind of activity.</li>
						<li>They noticed when displayed content was <b>directly related to their discipline,</b> instead of mixed with other disciplines like it is now. </li>
						<li>Moving queues off of the home screen and into their own page <b>didn't disrupt</b> their ability to add an activity to a queue.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
					<p class="large-margin-bottom">These tests were important in validating the design and getting additional data for what we should prioritize during implementation. </p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<div class="section-text">
					<h3 class="margin-bottom">High-fidelity design</h3>
					<p class="callout">After testing the designs, I created a high-fidelity prototype with components from Material Design, Google's design system that the company is adopting for newer projects.</p>
					<p>I designed with consideration for my findings during my design review, user feedback, user end-goals, and my observations from testing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="image-container"><img class="project-image" src="img/addactivity.gif"></div>
				<div class="section-text large-margin-bottom">
					<p>
						The redesign improves on the current design in many ways:
						<ul class="remove-indent bullet-list">
							<li>Activity quality is <b>easier to assess</b> with the larger thumbnails and number of saves and uses displayed.</li>
							<li>Key actions (previewing an activity and adding an activity to a queue) are more <b>findable</b> and <b>easier to access</b>.</li>
							<li>The visual design is <b>consistent, cohesive,</b> and <b>accessible</b> which makes the Library more <b>visually appealing</b> and <b>easier to use</b>.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="image-container"><img class="project-image" src="img/queuepage.gif"></div>
				<div class="section-text large-margin-bottom">
					<p>
						Providers often have many queues (sometimes around 40 or 50!) filled with many activities that they <b>frequently reorganize</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The new design gives them a space where they can view and manage their queues more easily with functionality like folders and copying activities to other queues.

				<h2>Outcomes</h2>
				<p>This is what I've done so far for this project:</p>
			<div class="section-text">
				<h4 class="margin-bottom">Highlight</h4>
				<p class="callout">I <b>established a process</b> for <b>usability testing</b> designs and documented the procedures for them.</p>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="image-container"><img class="project-image" src="img/testingdocs.png"></div>
			<p>✅ Established <b>usability testing process</b></p>
			<p class="large-margin-bottom">✅ Wrote usability testing <b>procedures and guides</b></p>
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>Prior to this project, there was no process or procedures for usability tests.</p>
				<p>I documented my entire process as I figured out the necessary steps to run tests and turned them into documentation for the team to use.</p>
				<p><b>I created guides and templates for:</b></p>
				<ul class="remove-indent bullet-list">
					<li>Setting up a research study.</li>
					<li>Contacting and recruiting users.</li>
					<li>Writing a usability test plan.</li>
					<li>Running a usability test.</li>
					<li>Reviewing and documenting insights.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This was my effort in reducing duplicate work and <b>enabling usability testing</b> for the rest of the design team.</p>
				<p>Testing is now a regular part of our design process and this documentation is used as guides for usability tests.</p>
