					I joined the newly formed public markets team when I joined Carta.
					Our teams goal was to take some of our existing private company features and expand them to be inclusive of public companies. These features include tracking and managing employee equity (stocks and options), exercising stock options, and selling stocks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Up to this point, Carta only supported private companies. Public company support was a high priority to prevent customer churn.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team built support for stock option exercises and sales for public employees. With this functionality, we hoped to retain our large, enterprise company customers as they went public. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We worked quickly to mitigate lost customers.

				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p class="callout">
					Carta lacked support for public companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					As private companies went public, and as the Carta platform could no longer support them, they would transition to other equity admin solutions, resulting in losses of our large customers.

						Support public companies by allowing their employees to exercise options and sell stock on Carta.

			<h2>Process (highlights)</h2>
			<h4><em>Challenge: Ambiguity</em></h4>
				<p>We didn't know much about our users aside from them being employees at large public companies. We made the assumption that most may know little to nothing about equity.</p>

				<p>Given how constrained we were on time, it didn't feel feasible to recruit users and do formal user interviews and usability tests. Still, it was easy enough for me to do some lightweight internal testing. </p>

				<p>I tested a high-fidelity prototype with Carta employees whose roles didn't require extensive knowledge about equity. This strategy was to more closely align our testing with the user we were designing for. </p>

				<p>I also tested the prototype with Carta employees with extensive equity knowledge. These employees had experience with equity transactions and had done them in other apps. They were able to point out some key areas of improvement in the design based on their past experiences.</p>

				<p>These tests helped inform my design decisions</p>

				<h3>Design decisions</h3>
			</div>
				<div class="image-container">
					<img class="project-image" src="img/helpful.png">
				</div>
				<div class="image-container">
					<img class="project-image" src="img/notaxes.png">
				</div>
				<div class="section-text xlarge-margin-bottom">
					<p>
						<b>1. Dynamic, transaction-relevant information.</b> I added useful information to help users better understand transactions. The information and different subsections displayed are dynamic and based on a few different factors, including equity type and transaction type.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="image-container">
					<img class="project-image" src="img/taxes.png">
				</div>
				<div class="section-text xlarge-margin-bottom">
					<p>
						<b>2. A tax breakdown for each transaction.</b> Taxes can have a high impact onb both exercises and sales. I included this detailed tax breakdown to help the user understand the true value of their transactions and make more informed decisions regarding their transaction.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="image-container">
					<img class="project-image" src="img/orders.png">
				</div>
				<div class="section-text xlarge-margin-bottom">
					<p>
						<b>3. A transaction history where the user can view order status.</b> These orders can take multiple days, up to a month, to complete. Displaying a transaction history and order statuses gives the user visibility into their various orders.
					</p>
				</div>

			<h4><em>Challenge: Development Speed</em></h4>
				</div>
				<div class="image-container">
					<img class="project-image" src="img/mobile.png">
				</div>
				<p class="image-caption">
					Mobile app concept that was demoed to key customers. Mobile support was a common customer request.
				</p>
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>Part of the team’s strategy in maintaining our pre-IPO customers was meeting with them and discussing what they needed out of Carta.</p>

				<p>Maintaining these relationships was a high priority, but ultimately constrained the time and effort we could spend developing the real product. Our requirements changed often, making it difficult to plan for the long-term. A percentage of our time was spent ensuring we had something interesting to demo each meeting. </p>


				<p>This situation led to some tradeoffs in the design, namely the amount of time we could spend researching and iterating on designs versus implementing. Often, I would be designing side-by-side with our front-end engineers as they built the UI and we would iterate together. </p> 
				<p>I did my best to help the team move as fast as possible without sacrificing too much design quality. I even jumped in and did some front-end code to make sure things were polished!

				<h2><em>Reflection</em></h2>
				<p>In the end, we were able to keep some of our biggest enterprise customers and even gain some new ones. I was happy the team was able to deliver something given our strict timelines. I found that proactivity within the team was valuable in moving things along at a good pace. </p>
				<p>This was my first professional project and I learned a lot from the experience.</p>
				<h4>What I would have done differently</h4>
				<p><b>Talk and test with external users.</b> In hindsight, it would have been easy to find and test the product with our user type, which was simply any equity-holding public company employee. This additional work would have helped me to speed up decision-making around the design.</p>

				<p><b>Get more value out of customer meetings.</b> We met with our customers regularly, but we didn’t get much helpful information to inform development. I wish we had sought specific and appropriate feedback from our customers to better inform our decision-making.</p>

				<h4>Further design improvements</h4>
				<p><b>Improved visual design.</b> We mostly relied on existing components with limited style choices, which left the UI lacking in some areas. The design could be improved through better visual design, for example, using typography to give the page a stronger visual hierarchy. Another potential improvement would be adding useful illustrations to support the descriptions of more complex concepts, such as a cashless exercise and sell transaction, instead of relying on words alone.</p>
				<p>
					If time permitted, I would have created a more ideal design that deviated from our component library and outlined its behavior for a future update.
