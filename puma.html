					My team was tasked with building equity administration support for public companies. Essentially, our goal was to take some of our existing private company features and rebuild them for public companies. These features include tracking and managing employee equity, exercising of stock options, and selling stocks. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Up to this point, Carta only supported private companies. Public company support was a high priority to prevent customer churn.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team built support for stock option exercises and sales for public employees. With this functionality, we hoped to retain large, enterprise company customers as they go public.

				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p class="callout">
					Carta lacked support for public companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					As private companies went public, and as the Carta platform could no longer support them, they would transition to other equity admin solutions, resulting in Carta losing their biggest customers.

			<h2>Process (highlights)</h2>
			<h4><em>Challenge: Ambiguity</em></h4>
				<p>
					All we knew about our users when starting was that many of them would be employees at large public companies who probably know little to nothing about equity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given how constrained we were on time, it didn't feel feasible to recruit users and do formal user interviews and usability tests (although, in hindsight, it wouldn't have been <em>that</em> difficult).
				</p>
				<p>
					Still, it was easy enough to do some lightweight user testing internally. I tested a high-fidelity prototype with Carta employees whose roles didn't involve extensive knowledge about equity. This strategy was to more closely align our testing with the user we were designing for. Through these tests, we were able to identify problem areas in the prototype, such as unclear instructions, and address them.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also tested the prototype with Carta employees with high-levels of equity knowledge. These employees were experienced with these types of transactions and some have done them in other apps. They were able to point out some key areas of improvement in the design based on their past experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					These tests helped me make key additions to the design, including:

					Mobile app concept that was demoed to key customers	
				</p>
			<div class="section-text">

				<p>
					Part of the team’s strategy in maintaining our pre-IPO customers was meeting with them and discussing what we needed to build to keep them on the platform post-IPO.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maintaining these relationships was a high priority, but ultimately constrained the time and effort we could spend developing the real product. Our requirements changed often, making it difficult to plan for the long term. A percentage of our time was spent ensuring we had something interesting to demo each meeting.
				</p>
				<p>
					As customer’s IPO dates approached, we worked at an increasingly fast pace. The loss of large, enterprise customers was significant, as many of them were recognizable names that strengthened the Carta brand and their contracts were high value.
				</p>
				<p>
					This situation led to some tradeoffs in the design, namely the amount of time we could spend researching and iterating versus implementing.

			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					With our goals in mind, I sought to keep the design as simple as possible without excluding helpful context and information for the user. Reusing existing UI components and patterns where it made sense allowed us to decrease development time and deliver value more quickly.
				</p>
				<p>
					I kept a tight feedback loop with our PM and engineers to ensure they understood the latest changes and updates to the designs as I made them. I hoped that it would keep the team more in sync, to make any pivots and sudden requests less jarring.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having some knowledge and experience with front-end web development allowed me to jump in and make updates to the front-end code where needed. This allowed me to ensure the front-end was polished without taking additional time from the engineers.
				</p>
				<p>
					These strategies helped the team move more quickly and reach our goals sooner.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In the end, we were able to keep some of our biggest enterprise customers and even gain some new ones. I was happy the team was able to deliver something given how constrained we were on time. I found that proactivity within the team was highly valuable in making meaningful progress with this project.</p>
				<h3><em>What I would have done differently</em></h3>
				<p>
					<b>Talk and test with users!</b> In hindsight, it would have been easy to find and test the product with our user type, which was simply any equity-holding public company employee. This additional work would have helped me to better refine the designs and speed up decision-making around the UI/UX.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Get more value out of customer meetings:</b>
		We met with our customers regularly, but we didn’t seem to get much value out of them in regards to helpful information to inform development. I wish we had sought specific and helpful information from our customers to better inform our decision-making.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Generate more ideas:</b> With the transaction experience, I felt like I followed our existing UI patterns a little too closely. This choice resulted in a more consistent experience on the platform, but may not have resulted in the best user experience. If I could go back, I would spend more time generating a breadth of ideas and looking at comparable experiences in other apps. Along with more testing and iteration, I think this strategy would have helped me arrive at a more effective design, even if it isn't as consistent with what already exists on Carta.
