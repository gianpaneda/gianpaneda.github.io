			<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p class="callout">
					<a href="https://carta.com/">Carta</a> helps companies and investors manage their cap tables, valuations, investments, and equity plans.
				</p>
				<p>
					My team was tasked with building equity administration support for public companies. Essentially, our goal was to take some of our existing private company features and rebuild them for public companies. These features include tracking and managing employee equity, exercising of stock options, selling stocks. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Up to this point, Carta only supported private companies. Public company support was a huge initiative and we were the first to take on the challenge.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team ended up building that support for stock option exercises and sales, along with other valuable public company features, including <b>trading plans for company insiders</b> and <b>form generation</b> to simplify filings with the SEC and IRS. With this functionality, we hoped to retain large, enterprise company customers as they go public.
				</p>
				<p>
					This page is specific to the development of <b>stock option exercises and sales</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team was composed of me and another product designer, along with 4-5 engineers and a product manager. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We worked on this project for about 8 months (from September 2017 to May 2018).

		<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p class="callout">
				Carta was losing large, private company customers as they IPO due to a lack of support and functionality for public companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				As these companies went public, and as Carta could no longer support them, they would move off the platform to other equity admin solutions, resulting in Carta losing their biggest customers. 
			</p>

		<div class="section">
		<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p class="callout">
				Support public company employees on Carta by developing equity management and other useful features specifc to public companies.

			<h2>Process (highlights)</h2>
			<h4><em>Ramping up and defining requirements</em></h4>
				<p>
					This was my first set of projects at Carta, and I needed to get ramped up quickly. I needed a thorough understanding of the context in order to work effectively with my teammates and my cross-functional partners.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was helpful to broaden my understanding of exercising and selling by talking to my teammates and our internal equity experts. They were able to help me close the many knowledge gaps I had starting out.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the most valuable things we gained from these conversations was clearly separating the necessary from the nice-to-haves. When necessary, we could exclude the nice-to-haves in favor of speed.
				</p>
			<h4><em>Challenge: Development Speed</em></h4>
				<p>
					With this project, we needed something that worked, and we needed it quickly. As customer’s IPO dates approached, we worked at an increasingly fast pace. The loss of large, enterprise customers was significant, as many of them were recognizable names that strengthened the Carta brand and their contracts were high value.
				</p>
				<p>
					This situation led to some tradeoffs in the design, namely the amount of time we could spend researching and iterating versus implementing.
				</p>
				<p>
					With our goals in mind, we sought to keep the design as simple as possible without excluding helpful context and information for the user. Reusing existing UI components and patterns where it made sense allowed us to decrease development time and deliver value more quickly.
				</p>
			<h4><em>Implementation</em></h4>
				<p>
					Because of the speed we were working at, a portion of our mockups were being created as the engineers were implementing them. Sometimes the UI wasn't implemented accurately, so I would jump in and make updates to the front-end code where needed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Having some knowledge and experience with front-end web development allowed me to ensure the design was polished without taking additional time from the engineers.
				</p>
			<h4><em>Challenge: Maintaining relationships with customers</em></h4>
				<p>
					Part of the team’s strategy in maintaining our pre-IPO customers was meeting with them and discussing what we needed to build to keep them on the platform post-IPO.
				</p>
				<p>
					These meetings also served as a way to build and maintain connections to these companies. We hoped to do so by demoing progress on the product and interactive prototypes of what we intended to build.
				</p>
				<p>
					We usually left these meetings with additional feature requests for the product.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maintaining these relationships was a high priority, but ultimately constrained the time and effort we could spend developing the real product. Our requirements changed often, making it difficult to plan for the long term. A percentage of our time was spent ensuring we had something interesting to demo each meeting.
				</p>
				<p>
					In an effort to save on development time, I looked at reusing existing UX/UI patterns in the product where it made sense. I also kept a tight feedback loop with our PM and engineers to ensure they understood the latest changes and updates to the designs. At the very least, this helped the team stay on the same page and move a little more quickly.
				</p>
			<h4><em>Challenge: Lack of user research</em></h4>
				<p>
					All we really knew about our users while designing was that many of them would be employees at large public companies who probably know little-to-nothing about equity.
				</p>
				<p>
					We didn’t take the time to do formal usability testing or interviews with prospective users, and without a dedicated user research team it didn't feel feasible to do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite the lack of specific information, it was still helpful for me to empathize with a low equity IQ user. Luckily, this was easy because I was still relatively new to the equity world at the time. It was easy to think to myself “Would I find this helpful?” while working out the design. 

				</p>
					This exercise helped me make key additions to the design, including:
					<ul>
						<li>Explaining important financial terms in the exercise workflow.</li>
						<li>A breakdown of each transaction’s calculations.</li>
						<li>An order tracker that displays their order status.</li>
					</ul>

				<p>
					A quick and easy way I got some signal on the design's effectiveness was testing within the company and team.
				</p>
				<p>
					Testing with our internal equity experts was especially helpful because they had prior experience with other equity administration and trading platforms. They had valuable insight into how other platforms handled the transaction experience and made meaningful suggestions.
				</p>

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>In the end, we were able to keep some of our biggest enterprise customers and even gain some new ones. I was happy the team was able to deliver something given how constrained we were on time. I found that proactivity within the team was highly valuable in progressing with this project.</p>
		<h3><em>What I would have done differently</em></h3>
		<p>
			<b>Talk and test with users!</b> In hindsight, it would have been easy to test the product with and interview our user type, which was simply any equity-holding public company employee. This additional work would have allowed me to generate more design ideas and help swiften decision-making around the UI/UX.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Get more value out of customer meetings:</b>
We met with our customers regularly, but we didn’t seem to get much value out of them in regards to helpful information to inform development. I wish we had sought more information or context from our customers to better inform our decision-making.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Generate more ideas:</b> When designing the transaction experience, I felt like I followed our existing UI patterns a little too closely, in order to save on development time. This choice resulted in a more consistent experience across the platform, but may not have resulted in the best user experience. If I could go back, I would spend more time generating a breadth of ideas and looking at comparable experiences in other apps. If it made sense, I would try to make the case to implement these designs that may not be consistent with other areas in the app.
