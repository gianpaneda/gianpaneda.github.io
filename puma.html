					I joined the newly formed public markets team when I started at Carta.
					Our team's goal was to take some of our existing private company features and expand them to work with public companies. These features include tracking and managing employee equity (stocks and options), exercising stock options, and selling stocks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Up to this point, Carta only supported private companies. Public company support was a high priority to prevent customer churn.
				</p>
				<p>
					I designed the transaciton experience for stock option exercises and stock sales for public employees. With this functionality, we hoped to retain our large, enterprise company customers as they went public. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We worked quickly to mitigate the loss of customers.
				</p>

				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p class="callout">
					Carta lacked support for public companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					As private companies went public, and as the Carta platform could no longer support them, they would transition to other equity admin solutions, resulting in losses of large customers.
				</p>

				<h2>Solution</h2>
					<p class="callout">
						Support public companies by allowing their employees to exercise options and sell stock on Carta.

			<h2>Process (highlights)</h2>
			<h4><em>Challenge: Ambiguity</em></h4>

			<div class="large-margin-bottom">	<p>We didn't know much about our users aside from them being employees at large public companies. I assumed that most may know little to nothing about equity.</p>
			
							<p>Given how constrained we were on time, it didn't feel feasible to recruit users and do formal user interviews and usability tests. Still, I squeezed in some time for some lightweight internal testing with a high-fidelity mockup.</p>
							
							<p>I tested a high-fidelity prototype with Carta employees of varying levels of equity experience.</p>
			
							<p>These tests helped inform my design decisions.</p>

			<h4><em>Challenge: Development Speed</em></h4>

					Part of a mobile app concept that I created in a day that was demoed to key customers. Mobile support was a common customer request.
				</p>
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>Our time constraint led to some tradeoffs in the design, namely the amount of time I could spend researching and iterating on designs before the team began implementation. Often, I would be designing side-by-side with our front-end engineers as they built the UI and we would iterate together. </p> 
				<p>I did my best to help the team move as fast as possible without sacrificing too much design quality. I even jumped in and did some front-end code to make sure things were polished!

				<h2><em>Reflection</em></h2>
				<p>In the end, we were able to keep some of our biggest enterprise customers and even gain some new ones. I was happy the team was able to deliver something given our strict timelines. I found that being proactive during this project was valuable in moving things along at a good pace. </p>
				<h4>What I would have done differently</h4>
				<p><b>Talk and test with external users.</b> In hindsight, it would have been easy to find and test the product with our user type, which was simply any equity-holding public company employee. This additional work would have helped me to speed up decision-making around the design.</p>

				<p><b>Get more value out of customer meetings.</b> We met with our customers regularly, but we didn’t get much helpful information to inform development. I wish we had sought specific and appropriate feedback from our customers to better inform our decision-making.</p>

				<h4>Further design improvements</h4>
				<p><b>Improved visual design.</b> We mostly relied on existing components with limited style choices, which left the UI lacking in some areas. The design could be improved through better visual design, for example, using typography more effectively to give the page a stronger visual hierarchy. Another potential improvement would be adding useful illustrations to support the descriptions of more complex concepts, such as a cashless exercise and sell transaction, instead of relying on words alone.</p>
				<p>
					If time permitted, I would have created a more ideal design that deviated from our component library and outlined its behavior for a future update.
