				<p>
					For this project, we were looking at opportunities to improve the public markets product. 
					The team did this by examining the unique responsibilities public companies have when compared to private companies
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the things we discovered was filing company insider forms for the SEC, an annoying but necessary task that public companies sometimes outsource. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We created the <em>SEC Forms</em> feature speed up and simplify the process of filling and filing the forms.

			<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p class="callout">
					<b>Filling</b> and <b>filing</b> SEC forms is a <b>costly and time-sensitive</b> process.
				</p>
				<p>
					These forms need to be filed within two business days of an applicable event, such as a sale of stock. Sometimes this work is outsourced to a third party, which can cost a company additional money.
				</p>
				<p>
					It can take time to gather the relevant information for the forms. This is important because failing to submit the correct forms before deadlines can result in investigation and punishment from the SEC.

				<h2>Solution</h2>
				<p class="callout">
					<b>Support</b> the user in <b>filling forms</b> by populating forms with <b>existing</b> Carta data.
				</p>
					With our solution, company administrators can go through a simple workflow to fill and edit forms. The forms are pre-filled with relevant data to reduce the amount of time spent gathering and inputting information that Carta already holds.

				<h3><em>Research</em></h3>
				<p>
					I spent time researching the form filling and filing process to understand how it is normally done and looked for ways to make it easier.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was helpful to talk to people at Carta who filed these forms themselves to get additional context.
				</p>
				<p>
					It also helped to look at real examples of filled SEC forms to get an understanding of what it looks like in its end state. Filled forms are made available to the public so I was able to find examples online.
				</p>
			</div>	
			<div class="section-text">
				<h4><em>Discovery: Electronic filings were most common</em></h4>
				<p>
					Through my research I learned that most people filed these required forms electronically, through an SEC website. The submitted forms needed to be in XML file format.
				</p>
				<p>
					We developed an XML export so that forms generated through Carta can be easily previewed, downloaded, and filed with the SEC. Users also have the option to print the forms if they prefer to submit them physically.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<h4><em>Discovery: "Explanation of responses" were time consuming to write</em></h4>
				<p>
					I learned that a particular part of the forms, explanation of responses, took a lot of time to write. These explanations were used to describe complex answers to parts of the form that aren't easily summed up with a simple date or number.
				</p>
				<p>
					I looked to address this problem in the design.

			<div class="section-text">
			<h3><em>Design decisions</em></h3>
				<p>I designed a multi-step form with the goal of addressing the users problems and making filling the forms quick and easy.</p>	
				<p>
					<b>Multi-step form:</b> I broke the form up into multiple steps to reduce its cognitive load. This helps the user focus on small groups of inputs at a time, as opposed to a large, intimidating form.
				</p>
			</div>				
				<div class="image-container">
					<img class="project-image" src="img/formsection.png">
				</div>
				<p class="image-caption">
					The forms structure and steps mirrors the actual form
				</p>
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					I separated the form into four steps, with three steps corresponding to a specific section of the actual SEC forms, and one step for reviewing.
				</p>
			</div>		

			<div class="section-text">
				<p><b>Pre-fill relevant information:</b> Carta holds a lot of information relevant to the forms, including personal information, securities held, and records of transactions.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image-container">

				One step of the four-step form workflow. Relevant information from Carta is pre-filled so that the user doesn't have to do it.
			</p>
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					To make filling the forms easier, Carta pre-fills the form with information from Carta that belongs on the form. This function helps the user complete the forms more quickly. Rather than filling it out from scratch, the user has a strong starting point.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					<b>Dynamic, pre-written explanations of responses:</b> 
					I worked with some of our form experts to create language for explanations that we can generate for the user based on the data Carta already has.
				</p>

				<p class="image-caption">
					Carta displays pre-written explanations of responses based on releveant user data like "date exercisable"
				</p>
				<p>
					These explanations often requires long, hand-written sentences. The language Carta generates is dynamic and based on the specific information about an insider's holdings. This function assists the user in filling out one of the most complex parts of the form.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I'm happy we were able to build and ship this in the time we had. Learning about the approach to the real life processes of form filing made it easier to see the opportunities for improvement. It was helpful to look at how the forms are normally filled and filed to understand the types of design decisions that would significantly improve the process for the user. 
				</p>
				<h3><em>What I would have done differently</em></h3>
				<p>
					<b>Actively seek feedback from beta users:</b> This feature didn’t see much use from our beta users. I would have liked for us to be more proactive in seeking feedback from them. I would have used that feedback to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and inform possible improvements.
