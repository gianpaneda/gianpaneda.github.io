				<p>
					For this project, we looked at opportunities to improve our newly introduced Public Markets product offering. The team did this by examining the unique needs and responsibilities of public companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					One thing we discovered was the process of filing forms to the SEC on behalf of company insiders, an annoying but legally required task that public companies tend to outsource.
				</p>
				<p>
					These forms report on the equity transactions of company insiders to ensure they are not unfairly benefitting from their insider status. Once reported, the trade information is made public on the SEC website.
				</p>
				<p>
					We created the <em>SEC Forms</em> feature speed up and simplify the process of completing and filing the forms.

			<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p class="callout">
					<b>Completing</b> and <b>filing</b> SEC forms is a <b>costly and time-sensitive</b> process.
				</p>
				<p>These forms need to be filed quickly and accurately. For example, Form 4 must be filed within two business days of an event, such as a sale of stock, with the complete details of the transactions that occurred. </p>

				<p>Because of the cumbersome and time-sensitive nature of the filing process, the work is often outsourced to a third party, which costs additional resources.</p>

				<p>On top of that, it takes time to gather the relevant information for the forms. When outsourcing, there is often back and forth communication between a company and the third party to communicate the required form information. Failing to submit the correct forms before deadlines, can result in investigation and punishment from the SEC.</p>

				<h2>Solution</h2>
				<p class="callout">
					<b>Support</b> the user in <b>completing forms</b> by populating forms with <b>existing</b> Carta data.
				</p>
				<p>
					With our solution, company administrators can go through a simple workflow to fill and edit forms. The forms are pre-filled with relevant data to reduce the amount of time spent gathering and inputting information that Carta already holds.

				<h3><em>Research</em></h3>
				<p>
					I spent time researching the form completion and filing process to understand how it is normally done and searched for ways to make it easier. It was helpful to talk to people at Carta who filed these forms themselves to get additional context.
				</p>
				<p>
					It also helped to look at real examples of filled SEC forms to get an understanding of what they look like in their end states. Filled forms are made available to the public so I was able to find many examples online.
				</p>
			</div>	
			<div class="section-text">
				<h4><em>Discovery: Electronic filings were most common</em></h4>
				<p>
					Through my research, I learned that most people filed these required forms electronically, through an SEC website. The submitted forms needed to be in XML file format.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section-text">
				<h4><em>Discovery: "Explanation of responses" were time consuming to write</em></h4>
				<p>
					I learned that a particular part of the forms, explanation of responses, took a lot of time to write. These explanations were used for complex answers to parts of the form that aren't easily summed up with a simple date or number.
				</p>

			<div class="section-text xlarge-margin-top">
			<h3><em>Design decisions</em></h3>
				<p>I designed a multi-step form to make the filing process easier by addressing problem areas in the existing process.</p>	
				<p>
					<b>Multi-step form:</b> I broke the form up into multiple steps to reduce its cognitive load. This helps the user focus on a single or small group of inputs in a step-by-step manner, as opposed to facing a single, large, intimidating form.

				<p class="image-caption">

				</p>
			<div class="section-text xlarge-margin-top">
				<p><b>Pre-fill relevant information:</b> Carta holds a lot of information relevant to the forms, including personal information, securities held, and records of transactions.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image-container">

				One step of the four-step form workflow. Relevant information from Carta is automatically filled by Carta.
			</p>
			<div class="section-text">
				<p>
					To make completing the forms easier, Carta pre-fills it with the information already on the platform. Rather than filling it out from scratch, the user has a much stronger starting point.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="section-text xlarge-margin-top">
				<p>
					<b>Dynamic, pre-written explanations of responses:</b> 
					I worked with some of our form experts to create explanations that we can generate for the user based on Carta data.

					Carta displays pre-written explanations of responses based on relevant user data like "date exercisable"
				</p>
				<p>
					These explanations often require long, hand-written sentences. The explanation Carta generates is dynamic and based on the specific information about an insider's holdings. This function assists the user in filling out one of the most complex parts of the form.
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon completing this workflow, users can preview and export their filled form in XML format to submit to the SEC.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I'm happy we were able to build and ship this in the time we had. Learning about the approach to the real-life processes of form filing made it easier for me to see the opportunities for improvement. It was helpful to look at how the forms are typically handled to understand the types of design decisions that would significantly improve the process for the user.
				</p>
				<h3><em>What I would have done differently</em></h3>
				<p>
					<b>Actively seek feedback from beta users:</b> This feature didn’t see much use from our beta users. I would have liked for us to be more proactive in seeking feedback to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and inform possible improvements.
